# ðŸŒ³ Intelligent Mistletoe Visualizer

This project will be a frontend interface based on React for an AI-powered mistletoe visualizer. Users will be able to upload images of trees to detect the presence of mistletoe, a parasitic plant that can be harmful to trees. The project is currently in the development phase, and we are just starting to build the frontend.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and accessible tool for users to upload photos of trees and, using an AI model (to be integrated in the future), automatically detect mistletoe in the images. Currently, we are in the early stages of frontend development, and at this phase, there is no full functionality or backend integration with the AI model yet.

### Main Objectives:
- **Create an interactive interface**: Users will be able to upload images intuitively and easily.
- **Detection Simulation**: the detection results will be simulated.
- **AI Integration**: The backend and AI model will be integrated to make the analysis accurate and automatic.

## Proposed Technologies

For the development of this project, the following technologies will be used:

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **HTML5 and CSS3**: For structuring and styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For frontend functionality and logic.

## Installation and Usage

This project is designed for users to access directly via a webpage. There will be no need for users to install or run anything on their local machines. All functionality will be available online once the development is complete.
