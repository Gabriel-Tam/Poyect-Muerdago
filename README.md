# 🌳 Intelligent Mistletoe Visualizer
This project is a frontend interface for an AI-powered mistletoe visualizer. Users can upload tree images to detect mistletoe, a parasitic plant harmful to trees. Currently, only the frontend is developed, with image analysis simulated until backend AI integration for automatic mistletoe detection is complete.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can select and upload photos of trees for analysis.
- **Mistletoe Detection Simulation**: The frontend simulates the detection process until backend integration with AI is complete.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and simple design to ensure easy interaction.

## Current Status

- **Frontend**: The user interface is fully functional and allows image uploads.
- **Backend**: Not yet integrated. The AI model for detecting mistletoe is under development.
- **Simulation**: For now, the analysis result is simulated, pending the actual integration of the AI model.

## Future Updates

- **Backend AI Integration**: The next step is to integrate an AI model that can analyze uploaded images and accurately detect mistletoe.
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Once integrated, the detection algorithm will be continuously optimized.
