This project is a frontend interface for an AI-powered mistletoe visualizer. Users can upload tree images to detect mistletoe, a parasitic plant harmful to trees. Currently, only the frontend is developed, with image analysis simulated until backend AI integration for automatic mistletoe detection is complete.
